## Data Visualization and Exploration practice
This repository focuses on the critical aspects of data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The lab emphasizes understanding the importance of visualization, applying effective plotting principles, and utilizing various Python libraries to gain insights from data.

### Project tasks:
Task 1: Demonstrate the importance of data visualization by creating a simple bar chart for categorical data frequency.

Task 2: Apply clarity, simplicity, and accuracy by creating a scatter plot using Seaborn.

Task 3: Explore visualizing 1D, 2D, and 3D data using Matplotlib.

Task 4: Conduct comprehensive EDA covering descriptive statistics, outlier detection, and correlation analysis.

Task 5: Create interactive visualizations using Plotly to enhance data exploration.

### Skills Obtained:
- Fundamentals of Data Visualization
- Matplotlib Proficiency
- Seaborn for Statistical Plots
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques
- Interactive Visualization

This lab provides a comprehensive hands-on experience in visualizing and exploring data, equipping me with essential skills for data analysis and communication.
